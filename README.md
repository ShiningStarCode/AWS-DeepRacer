# AWS-DeepRacer
This repository contains my work and progress as a participant in the AWS DeepRacer League. It includes my reward function code, configuration files, and results from various races. I am using this repository to track my progress and to showcase my skills in developing reinforcement learning models for autonomous vehicles.
